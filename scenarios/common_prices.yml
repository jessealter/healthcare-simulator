# These figures are intended to be based on the rate negotiated by your
# insurance company. With a plan that has a deductible, you'll be responsible
# for the full amount listed until your deductible is met. 

# The values provided here are estimates. To get a more accurate picture of your
# potential expenses, you should review your past medical usage, seek local cost
# estimates, or consult directly with your insurance provider.
# Keep in mind that some services have a lot of variability in cost, so you may
# need to provide an average or create your own service types. For example, a
# diagnostic test could cost $75 or $750 depending on the type of test.

# Note: The simulation will automatically use copay figures instead of these
# prices when applicable. Therefore, it is important that you only enter
# service costs here, and not copay amounts.
